Data analysis sample, using machine learning in Python, from my undergraduate thesis.

What is this?
==
This is a sample of code from my undergraduate Honors Neuroscience thesis at Dartmouth College, advised by Professor Michael Casey and Professor Richard Granger: "Comparing Decoding Approaches for Classfying Musical Genre from Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)". It includes Python code written in Jupyter and run on Dartmouth's Discovery cluster environment, maksing a set of brain data and running multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) on those masked brain images.
